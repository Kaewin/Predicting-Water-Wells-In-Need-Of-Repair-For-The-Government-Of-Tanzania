    "Tanzania, as a developing country, struggles with providing clean water to its population of over 57,000,000. There are many water points already established in the country, but some are in need of repair while others have failed altogether.\n",
    "\n",
    "Build a classifier to predict the condition of a water well, using information about the sort of pump, when it was installed, etc. Your audience could be an NGO focused on locating wells needing repair, or the Government of Tanzania looking to find patterns in non-functional wells to influence how new wells are built. Note that this is a ternary classification problem by default, but can be engineered to be binary.\n",
